# K Usecases

> Usecases &#x27;k_usecases&#x27; is a gem for documenting ruby code usecases from rspec

Welcome to your new ruby gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/k_usecases`.

When using the source code for this gem, start by running `bin/setup` to install locally or `bundle install`

To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt or run `exe/k_usecases` to see a list of commands.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'k_usecases'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
gem install k_usecases
```

## Stories


As a Technology Educator, I should be able to quickly document code libraries, so that I share knowledge quickly

- Create new gem
- Setup deployment pipeline
- Setup guard and unit tests


## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
